    <!-- STORY -->
    <p class="line">Hi Thikkalu,Kutta 😊</p>

    <p class="line">
        I wanted to make something different for you.
        Something simple, but straight from my heart.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        I still remember the first day we met in my shop.
        It looked ordinary to the world,
        but to me it quietly became special.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        Your bright smile, your beauty,
        the comfort in your presence —
        somehow it stayed with me.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        Without noise, without planning,
        you slowly became someone important in my life.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        Some feelings are difficult to say face to face…
        so I let this page speak for me.
    </p>

    <div id="pickupLine" class="pickup">
        “I know we will never be together, but please, allow me this much.
        Let me tell you how, in a sky crowded with stars, you remain the only one I see.
        How, among billions of faces in this world, it is only your eyes I ever search for.
        Let me tell you how you are the fire I would reach for without fear of being burned,
        the warmth I would choose, even knowing the cost.
        I know we will never be together, but please, allow me to love you aloud,
        to love you in ways you have never heard, perhaps never felt… even if only once.” ❤️

        I am not in a hurry for love.
        I am ready to wait as long as life asks me to.
        Decide freely, without fear.
        Your happiness will always matter to me,
        and destiny will take care of what is meant to be ❤️
